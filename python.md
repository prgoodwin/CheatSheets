# Declaring Variables

No key word is necessary to declare a variable. Type is declared implicitly.

```
x = 42
deep_thought_status = "not finished"
```

# Invoking Constructors

No "new" key word is required.

```
heart_of_gold = InfinityDrive()
```

# Declaring Classes

```
class MyClass:
    def __init__(input1, input2):
        self.one = input1
        self.two = input2
    def function:
        return 42
```
