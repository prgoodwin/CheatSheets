# Declaring Variables

No key word is necessary to declare a variable. Type is declared implicitly.

```
x = 42
deep_thought_status = "not finished"
```

# Declaring Classes

```
class MyClass:
    def __init__(input1, input2):
        self.one = input1
        self.two = input2
    def function:
        return 42
```

# Invoking Constructors

No "new" key word is required.

```
heart_of_gold = InfinityDrive()
```
# Conditionals

```
    if num > 0:
      return 1
    elif num == 0:
      return 0
    else:
      return -1
```     

# List Comprehension

```
abs_distances = [abs(pt) for ____ in ____]
```
