# CheatSheets

Welcome!  This is a resource developed for personal reasons to help others looking to build expertise.  In particular, I am growing my public content so that when I have professional conversations, I can do more than *say* I know something.  Instead, I can show them what I've done. 

I have a PhD in Computer Science (HCI), with a strong focus on user data modeling.  For the last four years I have worked in the IoT field honing my data pipeline and cloud skills.  I have worked on every level of the technology stack, from the analytics to the microservices to the React frontend.  And now, I'd like a way to showcase those skills.  

At this time, I am building resources that will work as foundation as I write tutorials, demo technologies, and create portfolio projects.
